If you wish to customize these files, first copy them
into the custom directory and use them from there.

If you try to use them from this direcotry, the next time 
DirectAdmin updates, your changes will be overwritten.
Your changes will only be safe if they are in the custom
directory.

DirectAdmin will first check the custom directory for
a template. If it can't find it, it will use the ones
in this directory.

The following templates can be used in the custom dir:

named.db
zone.conf
outlook_setup.reg
virtual_host.conf
virtual_host_secure.conf
virtual_host_secure_sub.conf
virtual_host_sub.conf
u_welcome.txt
r_welcome.txt
a_welcome.txt
email_pass_change/custom/index.html
reseller_limit.txt
user_limit.txt
message_tech.txt
message_user.txt
dns_a.conf
dns_mx.conf
dns_cname.conf
dns_ns.conf



If you want to rewrite all httpd.conf files with the new templates, run:
echo "action=rewrite&value=httpd" >> /usr/local/directadmin/data/task.queue


**IMPORTANT NOTE**
Regarding the template system, and all config files:
You must have a newline at the end of the files.
Failure to do so will result in unexpected behavior.
Go to the end, and press enter.
In DA a line is defined by a trailing newline character.
